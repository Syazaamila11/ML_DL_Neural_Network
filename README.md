#Neural Network
Hi I am Shazlyn Aszemi 

This is my first understanding (practically) on applying the theory of machine learning in very basic way.

If python functions is difficult to understand, you can always use help(“FunctionName”) help syntax in Python to learn about all of the functions that you’re using.

This code assumes Python version 2.7 or 3.5.

There are 5 key libraries that you will need to install. Below is a list of the Python SciPy libraries required for this tutorial:

1. scipy
2. numpy
3. matplotlib
4. pandas
5. sklearn

A machine learning project may not be linear, but it has a number of well known steps:

1. Define Problem.
2. Prepare Data.
3. Evaluate Algorithms.
4. Improve Results.
5. Present Results.

The best way to really come to terms with a new platform or tool is to work through a machine learning project end-to-end and cover the key steps. Namely, from loading data, summarizing data, evaluating algorithms and making some predictions.

If you can do that, you have a template that you can use on dataset after dataset. You can fill in the gaps such as further data preparation and improving result tasks later, once you have more confidence.

Have fun learning ! -z
