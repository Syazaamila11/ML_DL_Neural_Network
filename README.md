A machine learning project may not be linear, but it has a number of well known steps:

Define Problem.
Prepare Data.
Evaluate Algorithms.
Improve Results.
Present Results.

The best way to really come to terms with a new platform or tool is to work through a machine learning project end-to-end and cover the key steps. Namely, from loading data, summarizing data, evaluating algorithms and making some predictions.

If you can do that, you have a template that you can use on dataset after dataset. You can fill in the gaps such as further data preparation and improving result tasks later, once you have more confidence.
